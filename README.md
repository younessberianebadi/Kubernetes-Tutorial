# Kubernetes Tutorial

### Deployment

You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

### Service

When creating a service, you have the option of automatically creating a cloud network load balancer. This provides an externally-accessible IP address that sends traffic to the correct port on your cluster nodes provided your cluster runs in a supported environment and is configured with the correct cloud load balancer provider package.
